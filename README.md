# House Rent Predictor

A Machine Learning model to predict the rent price of the house based on the parameters like area.
I have done some feature engineering an to generalise the regression model and make accurate predictions.
Dataset extracted from the website kaggle.com and uploaded in the .csv file.

# Aim: To Predict Monthly House Rent.

## Approch:

* The models tried out in this project are:

* Linear Regression

*  Import Dataset and have a Quick look at it.

* Analyze and Clean Data. Look into each and          feature and make them clean for use.

* Visualize and have a look how features related with  monthly rent.

* Feature engineering

* Model training

* Evaluation :
     The models were evaluated on the basis of two metrics.
     1. R2score

     2. Mean Absolute Error

* Running the project on local machine:
  Building API - for local testing of model using flask

* pushing repositary on git 

* aws
